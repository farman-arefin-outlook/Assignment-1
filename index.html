                <p><span class="gray">
                        The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the
                        flavor. After
                        fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa
                        nibs, which are then
                        ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form.

                        and Middle Eastern cuisines.
                        Flour,semolina, grains or nuts form the base of a halwa and is garnished with nuts. It is known
                        differently as aluva,

                <h3>Mutton</h3>
                <p><span class="gray">Marinating not only makes the meat tender, but also adds moisture to it, further
                        making it juicy. One way to make mutton
                        tender is to cook it slow. As per Chef Amit, braising or slow cooking the mutton for more than 3
                        hours on low
                        temperature helps soften it.</span></p>
